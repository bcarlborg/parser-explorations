# TODOs

_here I keep a very loose list of things I would like to do in the near future. This is niether garunteed to be accurate or up to date, and exists purely to help manage the author's sanity :P_

- [ ] write naive brute force parser for a grammar
  - [ ] look into how we handle recursively iterating through the productions without
        going into an infinite loop!
- [ ] write some tests
- [ ] setup linting and formatting
- [ ] get all js files built wit tsc to build into their own dist/ directory
- [ ] find a .gitignore template that works well for TS projects
- [ ] write a grammar for true BNF grammars
- [ ] write a function that converts our EBNFs into BNFs
- [ ] should I use OOO for the parsers? have one root abstract parser that everything else attempts to read from?
  - I should really look into what the right way to do this with FP is.
